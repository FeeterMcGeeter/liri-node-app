# liri-node-app

### Description
**Liri** is the language equivalent of **Siri**.  Instead of speaking a command, we use text to ask for information.  In this app, you will use the command line to ask **Liri** about songs from Spotify, venues for a particular band or artist, or search for information on your favorite movies.  

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the command line
2. Run the following command 
   - node liri.js ... followed by one of the following
     - concert-this <artist/band name here>
     - spotify-this-song <song name here>
     - movie-this <movie name here>

You can even run the following command to see the information from the default text file
- node liri.js do-what-it-says
